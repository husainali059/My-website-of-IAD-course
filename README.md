# My-website-of-IAD-course
This is the official project site for the Intro to App Development (IAD) course by Hussain Ali Jahangir, hosted at hussain123.somee.com. It features interactive lab demonstrations, problem statements, code reports, and sample outputs from Labs 2 to 6. The website provides a clean, responsive design for easy navigation and showcases my practical work throughout the course.
